Part A:
Using the BM Font's sdf shader for text, I created a scene that allows you to rotate the camera with the mouse, rotate the text box, change the color of the text, change width of the text box, change to 4 different typefaces, change the text scale, and change the text itself.

Part B:
I implemented as shadertoy scene where the only geometry from THREE js is the plan to hold the fragment shader.
The scene used SDF models that grow and shrink over time that is offseted so it does not repeat as often.
The objects include a cub and a sphere that is passing each other over time and the sphere is subtracted from the cube. 
The sphere is not visible but the cube has a phong shader that uses the colors from an image to give it textures.

Part C:
For my final project, I am implementing God rays in Unity.
More details in the pdf.
I will be working with Andrew Gwinner and Jacob Le.
