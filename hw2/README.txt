For part A, my 3D scene used a skybox from Humus.name and had a terrain generated from Nathan Altice's face.
The water is a plane that uses a normal map to create its flow. The shader allows the the material to both reflect and refract light.

Part B:

For part B I used a hand from Google poly and added a particle system using the GPUParticlesystem to make it seem that the wrist is bleeding.
I consider a bleeding wrist a natural phenomenon. The material for the hand is generated using perlin noise, creating this flowing effect.
I find this effect similar to the numbing feeling you get when you lose a lot of blood, if that has ever happened to you, so i feel it fits.
